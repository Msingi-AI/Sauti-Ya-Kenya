# Sauti Ya Kenya üéôÔ∏è
Building Authentic Kenyan Swahili Text-to-Speech

## Overview
Sauti Ya Kenya is an innovative project aimed at developing a natural and authentic Kenyan Swahili Text-to-Speech (TTS) system. Current TTS solutions fail to capture the unique characteristics of Kenyan Swahili, including our natural code-switching between Swahili and English, local expressions, and authentic accent patterns.

## Project Goals
- Create a high-quality TTS model specifically trained on Kenyan Swahili speech
- Preserve authentic pronunciation, intonation, and rhythm patterns
- Handle code-switching between Swahili and English naturally
- Support common Kenyan expressions and local dialects
- Develop an easy-to-use API for integration into various applications

## Technical Architecture
The project will utilize:
- Deep learning models for speech synthesis
- Large-scale Kenyan Swahili speech dataset
- Natural Language Processing for text preprocessing
- Advanced acoustic modeling for proper pronunciation

## Getting Started

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from developers, linguists, and Swahili speakers. More details coming soon.
